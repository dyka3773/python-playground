# Python Playground: Geeky Projects For The Curious Programmer

This project will contain my solutions for the book "Python Playground: Geeky Projects For The Curious Programmer" by Mahesh Venkitachalam.

> NOTE: This is an ongoing project. I will update this README as I complete each project.

## Part 1: Warming Up

### 1. Parsing iTunes Playlists

### 2. Spirographs

## Part 2: Simulating Life

### 3. Conway's Game of Life

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.
It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.
One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.
It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.

In this project, you will implement Conway's Game of Life using Python.
You will learn to use `matplotlib` to visualize the game and it's animation.
And you will also use `numpy` to set up the game board and perform the game logic.
